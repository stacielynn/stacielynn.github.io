			<img src="images/cartwheel.png" alt="SLB doing a cartwheel" title="SLB doing a cartwheel">

			<p>An ambitious brand builder, I have led teams in dramatic transformations of creative marketing and results many times over, on large complex businesses at BBDO.</p>

			<p>On the Executive Leadership Team for 20 years, I've helped shape agency creative culture, driven best practices, and led talent development.</p>

			<p>A devoted business partner to clients, I combine strong vision and strategic acumen with a passion for helping them be brave. A tireless champion of multidiscipline client/agency teams, I create a trust-filled environment where people can take risks and do their best work.</p>  

			<p>I'm fresh from a one-year sabbatical, or "career shavasana" as I called it, and ready to start building again:</p>

			<ul>

			<li>Brands and businesses</li>
			<li>People and teams</li>
			<li>Business partnerships</li>
			<li>Organizational reputations</li>

			</ul>
